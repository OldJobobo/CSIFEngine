# CSIFEngine
 # C# Interactive Fiction Engine 
 
 A lightweight open-source Interactive Fiction (Game) Enigine.   While Inform 7+ dominates the space for IF engine frameworks, 
 and most others have died off or been abandoned, I feel that there is a need for something that is directly code based vs. the 
 natural language scripting that Inform uses.  
 
 ## Why C#?
 
 I am using C# because it is the language I have the most experience with and since Unity also uses C# it makes it easier
 to apply parts of this code for those working in Unity to do similar things.

## Why are you making CSIFEngine?

Formost this is a learning exercise to help me better understand OOP concepts and how they are applied in C#. Also, I grew up
in the 80's playing many Text Adventures and I've dabbled at trying to code them off and on over the years so in a way this
is both nostalgia and the fullfillment of a childhood dream for me.  I also think that this would serve as a great learning tool
for those wanting to learn to code in C#.
