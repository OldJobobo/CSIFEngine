# CSIFEngine: C# Interactive Fiction Engine

CSIFEngine is an open-source, lightweight Interactive Fiction (IF) engine designed for developers who prefer a 
code-based approach to the natural language scripting employed by engines like Inform 7. This engine allows you 
to create rich and immersive text-based adventure games using the versatile and powerful C# programming language.

## Why C#?

C# has been chosen as the foundation of CSIFEngine due to its widespread use, ease of learning, and its
compatibility with popular game development platforms like Unity. By using C#, developers can easily integrate 
the engine into existing projects or leverage their knowledge of the language to build new interactive fiction 
games.

## Why Create CSIFEngine?

The primary motivation behind the development of CSIFEngine is to provide a learning platform for understanding 
and applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C#. Moreover, interactive fiction games have been a 
source of nostalgia for many who grew up in the 80s, playing classic text adventures. Developing CSIFEngine 
fulfills a long-standing dream of creating a modern, code-based IF engine that can inspire a new generation of 
game developers.

## Learn and Grow with CSIFEngine

CSIFEngine is not only a powerful tool for creating interactive fiction games but also serves as an invaluable 
earning resource for those looking to sharpen their C# programming skills. By utilizing the engine, developers 
can explore the intricacies of OOP concepts and gain a deeper understanding of the language, which can be applied 
to a wide range of software development projects.
